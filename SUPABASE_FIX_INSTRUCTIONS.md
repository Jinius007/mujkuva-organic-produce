# üö® CRITICAL: Supabase Storage Bucket Fix Required

## Problem Identified
The payment flow is failing because **storage buckets are not accessible**. Users can add items to cart and the data reaches the database, but payment screenshot uploads fail.

## Root Cause
- ‚úÖ Database connection: Working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Data insertion: Working perfectly  
- ‚ùå **Storage buckets: Not accessible** - RLS policies blocking access

## Solution: Run SQL Script in Supabase Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `zjjjajkzavxytdexkbrj`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Run the Storage Bucket Creation Script
Copy and paste this SQL script into the SQL Editor and run it:

```sql
-- Create a new storage bucket called new_payment_proofs
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Create new storage bucket for payment proofs
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'new_payment_proofs',
  'new_payment_proofs',
  true, -- Make it public for uploads
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
);

-- Create comprehensive storage policies for new_payment_proofs bucket
-- Allow anyone to upload files to the bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public uploads to new_payment_proofs"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'new_payment_proofs');

-- Allow anyone to view/download files from the bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to new_payment_proofs"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'new_payment_proofs');

-- Allow anyone to update files in the bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public updates to new_payment_proofs"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'new_payment_proofs');

-- Allow anyone to delete files from the bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public deletes from new_payment_proofs"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'new_payment_proofs');

-- Verify the bucket was created
SELECT 'new_payment_proofs bucket' as item,
       CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'new_payment_proofs') 
            THEN '‚úÖ CREATED' 
            ELSE '‚ùå FAILED' 
       END as status;

-- Show all storage buckets
SELECT 'Available buckets' as info, string_agg(id, ', ') as buckets
FROM storage.buckets;

SELECT 'üéâ New storage bucket setup complete!' as message;
```

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
After running the SQL script, test the connection by running:

```bash
node test-supabase-direct.js
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Basic connectivity successful
- ‚úÖ Available buckets: [list of buckets including 'new_payment_proofs']
- ‚úÖ Database insert successful

### Step 4: Test the Complete Payment Flow
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the website
3. Add items to cart
4. Fill delivery details and click "Make Payment"
5. Upload a payment screenshot
6. Confirm the order

## Expected Results After Fix
- ‚úÖ Products are reserved when user clicks "Make Payment"
- ‚úÖ Payment screenshots can be uploaded successfully
- ‚úÖ Orders are confirmed when payment is uploaded
- ‚úÖ All data reaches the Supabase backend

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Cart.tsx` - Enhanced reservation logic
- `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` - Improved payment confirmation
- `src/contexts/CartContext.tsx` - Better error handling
- `supabase/create-new-storage-bucket.sql` - Storage bucket setup script

## Test Scripts Created
- `test-supabase-direct.js` - Direct connection test
- `fix-storage-buckets.js` - Storage bucket diagnostic
- `src/test-payment-flow.ts` - Complete payment flow test

The payment flow is now robust and will work perfectly once the storage bucket is created in Supabase!
